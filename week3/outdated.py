# Steps:
#  1. Finish dateToArray()
#  2. Finish isValidDate()
#  3. Finish dateToISO()
# See the tests for each function and understand what are the expected inputs and what should be the correct output for each one
# and why is the problem divided in such a way
# also, review the tests and add some more if you deem it necessary

# string -> [string]
# consumes a date string
# where the date has the format: MM/DD/YYYY or
#                                Month DD, YYYY
# and produces an array of strings with the format: [MM, DD, YYYY]
def dateToArray(input):
    # Hints:
    #   - You just need to turn a string made up form words and numbers, separated by spaces and commas,
    #     into an array that contains each word and number
    #   - It doesnÂ´t matter what the string contains, just how it is separated
    #   - For convenience, remove all leading and trailing white space from your string; it will make your work easier
    #   - Option 1 [easier]: 
    #       - Does python have a built-in function that allows to *split* a string into separate values?
    #       - If so, which values should you choose to cut up the string? 
    #         Do you need to remove any characters before cutting the string?
    #         Does python have a built-in function for removing or *replacing* values within a string?
    dateArr = input.replace(",", " ").replace("/", " ").replace("  "," ").split(" ")
    #   - Option 2 [more labor intensive]:
    #       - How would you go through a string?
    #       - You want to check each character and if its a value you want to keep, save it somewhere (like a string)
    #         each item in the output array will be one of these sub-strings you form
    #       - Which character(s) in the string would help you to know where a word begins and ends? This is your delimiter
    #       - The number of unique delimiters you find inside your string should be 1 less 
    #         than the number of items in your output array, can you see why? 

    return dateArr 

# [string] -> boolean
# produces true if the given date array has the format [MM,DD,YYYY]
#          false otherwise

def isValidDate(dateArr):
    # Hints:
    #   - Do you need to see every item in the array? or maybe just a couple of them? maybe just day and month
    #   - What takes for a month to be valid?         be 1-12 or jan-dec
    #   - What takes for a day to be valid?           1-31
    #   - The input array should have the format [MM,DD,YYYY] to be valid
    #     and only months can be a text value, so out of the 3 indexes in the array 
    #     only one could have a text value and still be a valid array
    #   - To know if a month in text form is valid you should check if it is in some set of values (maybe a list or a dictionary)

    #this contemplating that it uses the array from the function above which already has the array with the date
    #my logic is that the array is gonna be iterated to separate it and then check if the month and day are valid

# [string] -> string
# consumes a VALID date array with the format: [MM,DD,YYYY]
# produces a date string with the format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)
def dateToISO(dateArr):
    # Hints:
        # At this point you're almost done, just need to do a few things more
        # You should replace any text value for a month with its numeric value (maybe use a dictionary, why?)
        # You should have an array that's ready to be *joined* into a string using the right delimiter 
        # find out if there is a built-in function to do this)
        # NOTE: here you might end up repeating the same logic you used in isValidDate() 
        #       to determine if a text valued month is valid or not
        #       Repetition should be avoided as much as possible, but in this case it is "simpler" to do it this way
        #       As a challenge you can try to avoid those repeated bits of logic (after you have finished the original problem)
        #       Hint: there are probably many ways to do this, one such way could be:
        #                       modify isValidDate() to produce False if the array isn't valid
        #                       and if the array is valid and it contains a month in text format then 
        #                       produce a new array with the value of the month replaced with its numeric value
        #                       Then you will need to modify the main() function to save the produced array if it was valid
        #                       and then pass that to the dateToISO() function
        #                       In the dateToISO() function you would need to remove the logic to replace the text formatted month
        #                       to its numeric value, since that functionality now lives in isValidDate()
        #                       Also you should update the tests to take these changes into account
